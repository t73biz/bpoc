# Bodyless Module Proof of Concept -- BPOC

## Concept
BPOC is a module for Drupal 8, built with a block plugin, that integrates React into the block. This is a proof of
concept module built to test out the viability in taking this approach. The module uses the term 'bodyless' as it relies
on Drupal 8 only as the delivery mechanism for the view. There is not any reliance directly on Drupal 8 from a 'model' or
'controller' perspective.

In this module, there are some configuration settings for using this module as it is, but that is simply by choice, as the
integration of that configuration into React is also testing the viability for passing in Drupal 8 variables to the React app.
